4. Technology Stack

Layer	              Technology	                         Description

Frontend            	React.js	                  Component-based UI development
Backend	             Node.js, Express	              RESTful API development and server-side logic
Database            	MongoDB                       NoSQL database for storing users, posts, messages
Real-Time Engine	    Socket.io	                  Real-time messaging and notifications
Authentication	       JWT, bcrypt	                  Secure login and password management

5. System Architecture

 Frontend: React.js with context or Redux for state management, responsive design using CSS or libraries like Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap.
 Backend: Express.js RESTful API endpoints for all core operations, structured into modular routes and controllers.
 Database Schema: MongoDB collections for users, posts, messages, and notifications.
 WebSocket Layer: Socket.io for real-time chat and alerts, implemented with client and server-side integration.

6. Deployment
   
The application uses MongoDB as its primary database. It is hosted based on project needs—either locally, 
on a custom cloud VM (such as AWS EC2), or through a managed service like MongoDB Atlas for scalability and cloud access.

8. Security Considerations

Input validation and sanitation
Secure password handling
Protected routes and token verification
Rate limiting and CORS policy configuration

8. Future Enhancements

Group chat or community features
Advanced analytics dashboard for user engagement
Content moderation tools (e.g., keyword filtering or abuse detection)
Push notifications using service workers
Admin panel for managing users and reports
